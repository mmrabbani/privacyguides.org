description: Photo management and cloud storage tools that support E2EE, meaning the provider cannot access photos that you take
---
Most cloud storage solutions that are aimed at photo management are not encrypted end-to-end (E2EE). This means that the provider has access to all of the data you upload. We recommend some options below which use E2EE keep your private photos private, while allowing you to share them only with family and trusted people.

## Criteria

**Please note we are not affiliated with any of the projects we recommend.** In addition to [our standard criteria](about/criteria.md), we have developed a clear set of requirements to allow us to provide objective recommendations. We suggest you familiarize yourself with this list before choosing to use a project, and conduct your own research to ensure it's the right choice for you.

!!! example "This section is new"

    We are working on establishing defined criteria for every section of our site, and this may be subject to change. If you have any questions about our criteria, please [ask on our forum](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/latest) and don't assume we didn't consider something when making our recommendations if it is not listed here. There are many factors considered and discussed when we recommend a project, and documenting every single one is a work-in-progress.

### Minimum Requirements

- Must enforce end-to-end encryption or be self-hostable
- Must offer a free plan or trial period for testing.
- Must support TOTP or FIDO2 multi-factor authentication, or Passkey logins.
- Must offer a web interface which supports basic file management functionality.
- Must allow for easy exports of all files/documents.
- Must use standard, audited encryption.
- Must be open-source.

### Best Case

- Should have a published audit from a reputable, independent third-party.
